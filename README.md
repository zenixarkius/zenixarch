This branch is me testing out turning my arch setup into something like QubesOS. The reason I passed on just using Qubes is because it's too heavy, I'm not interested in Fedora or GUIs, I am especially not happy with losing wayland.

I have no idea if I will actually finish it or not, I am honestly reconsidering it because:
1. what is the point of having this much power in a PC just to cripple it with performative security upgrades with a performance tax in the name of experimentation
2. this is somewhat of a monumental task...
